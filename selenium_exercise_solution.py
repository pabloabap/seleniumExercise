'''
    Goals of this exercise:
        - Learn about Selenium library
        - Find web elements using different Selenium methods (css selectors, id, xpath, tag name)
        - Intereact with web elements throught clicking, sending keys and cleaning commands.
        - Extract data from the web
        - Read and write file

    Description:
        You have a dinner with some friends on your house tomorrow. You created a list of products that you need to prepare it
        and now is the moment to buy it online.
        From "purchase_list.csv" file which contains the category, the product and the amount of product to buy add all
        the products to the cart and extract its name, unit price and total price of each product and total price of the
        purchase. Export this details to a file named "purchase_ticket.txt".
    ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
        **IMPORTANT**: 
        - The product selected must have the cheapest unit price of its section.
        - Use time.sleep function to create a delay between some actions. It would happen that you want to access
        an element before it is charged and the program breaks
        - VPN would cause interferences with the webdrive, please try to execute the program without it

                the amount is satisfied.(for example if you nedd 3 tomatoes click on add to cart and then add 2 more 
                units of the product).
        _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
            *TIPS*
            - As this function would be very long you can split it three parts:
                1. add_products: find an item, its section and apply the following 3 modules to reach the finall result of add
                new element to the cart
                2. add_product_to_the_cart: add the first unit of a product in the char
                3. cheapest_product_of_the_section: compare the price of all the product of the section and identify the cheapest one.
                4. add_more_units: add more unit of an item if is needed.
            - It my happen that when you add the first item to a cart one the web show a pop up asking you about create an
            account. Send an "ESC" key to ignore it and continue with your purchase.
